    "Image classification is a growing field in machine learning with numerous deep learning techniques that are continuously being improved to increase accuracy and applicability across various industries. There have been numerous cases where image classification is used, such as in self-driving cars, traffic control, quality control, and more. In this case, we take a common problem in recognizing animal faces through machines. The task involves classifying animals based on their facial features, which has its own unique challenges due to various appearances across species. There have been multiple applications in wildlife conservation, pet identification, and veterinary diagnostics where similar model are being used to help them catagorize animals in photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, two machine learning architectures are used: **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**. The objective is to compare these two models and determine which architecture is more suitable for this task. Using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves, we can determine which model performs better in classifying the images."

    "As mentioned before, the ROC curve considers the *true positive rates* and the *false positive rates*. Meanwhile, the Precision-Recall curve also considers for the *false negatives rates* through *precision* and *recall* values, hence the name. Similarly, the Precision-Recall curve shown in *Figure 4* was also plotted seperately for each class alongside their AUC values. \n",

    "We can see that the CNN model also performs better than the ANN model based on their AUC values. Each class in the CNN model has the same AUC value of **0.99**, while the AUC values for the ANN model differs, ranging from **[0.90, 0.93]**. Again, the difference indicates that the CNN model is superior."

    "During the process of modelling the ANN model, several attempts were made to increase its accuracy. The first intuition was to increase the number of neurons along with the number of hidden layers. This resulted in lower loss for both training and validation data. However, the model tends to overfit, which leads to lower validation accuracy compared to the previous simpler model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to combat this, several regularizations methods were used, such as multiple `Dropout` layers after every `Dense` layer and adding *L2 kernel_regularization* to every layer. But to no avail, this resulted in a huge spike in both training and validation loss, which further lower the overall accuracy. It also creates more instability during training that is shown in *Figure 1* with the spikes in accuracy over every epoch. Additionally, increasing the number of neurons and hidden layers significantly increased the model's memory usage, which can cause more problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon is due to the nature of the ANN model itself, which is far more prone to overfitting in image classification compared to the CNN model. The tradeoff between accuracy and loss on the ANN model explains how each of the evaluations metrics shows that the CNN model was able to perform better than the ANN model. "

    "Despite both models having high accuracy with well over 80%, they still struggle to predict some of the images shown above. This occurs due to the accuracy itself was achieved using validation data, which was possibly taken from same source as the training data. When the models are introduced to new, random data from different sources on the internet, they might fail to predict correctly due to the noise of the data. The noise that the model was not trained on, such as the background of the animal they are trying to predict. Another possibility is because the training data was resized to a lower resolution, which removes some of the details from the image. Alternatively, the model may simply not have been trained with enough data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all of the limitations, the CNN model still performs better than the ANN model. It is shown that in images 0, 3, and 4, the ANN model fails to predict the animal accurately, where the CNN model was able to predict it. On the other hand, in image 2, both models fail to predict the animal due to the limitations mentioned before. However, in images 1, and 5, both models are able to predict the images correctly."

    "Both model managed to achieve high accuracy, with **95.47%** for the CNN model and **83.13%** for the ANN model. However, all of the evaluations consistently show that the CNN model is superior to the CNN model. Additionally, the CNN model was able to predict more accurately on outside data from random source in the internet. This makes the CNN model a clear winner for image classification tasks compared to the ANN model due to how each model handles data and its architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue for the ANN model in image classification is how sensitive it is towards overfitting. To capture more detail and improve accuracy, it requires an increase in the number of neurons and hidden layers, which also increases the likelihood of overfitting. At the same time, adding regularization to generalize the model leads to spikes in loss that lower the accuracy even further, contrary of what we are trying to achieve. Furthermore, adding more neurons and hidden layers significantly increases the memory usage, which causes scalability issues in the future applications."
